PROJECT SCOPE
To diagnose the possible problem based on the test report values.
The doctors can ehter the patient's report as input (Sugar level, Age, Blood pressure etc).
Using the system we are predicting if the patient is having a heart disease or diabetes by analysing the available data set.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
For Web UI design we are using Rshiny addon provided by Rstudio.
We are using R programming language as our coding language.
We used Rstudio IDE.
The datasets are taken from UCI repository.

PROJECT APPROACH
We are capturing the test report input from UI and store it in a table.
We have created a table with the existing data set which has all the records.
We have used Na√Øve Bayes' algorithm to create a model.
Based on the model and the test data we are predicting if the patient can have heart disease or diabetes.
